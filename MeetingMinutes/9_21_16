Will's ANN/GANN Paper
	Waiting on code from Will

Acquiring and using stems, full songs, etc
	If we can't acquire the stems, how do we extract the information?
	Reverb in datasets & normalization to extra stems from music
	*** MiDi dataset as proof of concept - run w/MiDi dataset

Tensorflow - install & setup
	60 stems into spectograms
	http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.spectrogram.html

Mix some dank beats: TBD
	Audacity

Extract instruments in music

TODO:
Spectrograms
Determine mixing tool [audacity?]
MiDi to mp3 script to create test dataset
